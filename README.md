#### This is an application that determines the types of a triangle based on length inputs from the user. ,  24th August 2018.
#### By Derrick Kariuki.
## Description
This is a 2-player turn-based game of probability. Opponents accumulate points by rolling a die each turn until they either hit a one (and lose their points), or choose to hold and keep what they've aggregated.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* In order to work the application locally on your computer you will need to have both Git and a working browser preferably chrome browser installed in your computer.
* Clone or download the website URL from my git hub account locally
* Clone the repository to a local directory
* open the index.html file using the browser to view the game.

## How to work through the Application
* Open index.html with a browser.
* Enter each players name.
* Click play!
* Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* Enjoy.
